Hello and welcome. I’m a clinical psychotherapist, and I provide a mindfulness-based approach to psychotherapy and counselling.

My practice is based in South Devon, just outside of Totnes. I also provide online psychotherapy and counselling to individuals all over the UK and the world. I’ve found online therapy to be an effective way for people to access help and support; and for me it’s a joy to be able to work with people regardless of where they’re living.

I’ve been in clinical practice since 2014. My primary professional training was at the Karuna Institute in Devon. Karuna is one of the oldest centres worldwide to provide psychotherapy training based on Buddhist mindfulness practice.

I have a Diploma in relational mindfulness, and an MA in mindfulness-based Core Process Psychotherapy from Middlesex University London.

Alongside my work, I am a father and husband, and draw deeply on the interconnectedness of life and the earth.
